    "We Are Not Our Own": {
        "content": "A Lesson from John Calvin We should dedicate ourselves to God. This is pleasing to Him (Romans 12:1). We no longer live, but Christ lives and reigns in us (Romans 14:8, Galatians 2:20). Rather than depend on our own understanding, which leads to destruction, we should follow Gods lead, and He will renew our minds (Romans 12:2, Ephesians 4:2). All our actions should be channeled through sobriety (temperance, chastity, discipline), righteousness (equity to all), and godliness (connecting us with God); and be zealous in doing good works (Titus 2:11-14). Know that we are pilgrims in this world. Focus on our heavenly inheritance, which is based on what Christ has done for us. We should not long excessively for wealth, power, human favor, and honor. God curses those too eager for riches and honor. They may have them but without true happiness. Remove pride and ostentation and other things caused by self-love (Matthew 16:24). Never use fraud to get fortunes. Never think of prosperity apart from Gods blessing. Attribute your success entirely to God, never to yourself. Everything we have are gifts from God. Intellect or labor are worthless unless the Lord prospers them. We are merely stewards of Gods gifts, so use them to serve the church and our neighbors (1 Corinthians 4:7, 12:12). Honor and love everyone, including strangers, evil people, and our enemies, because we are all made in the image of God (1 Corinthians 13:4, Galatians 6:10, Isaiah 58:7). Remove self-love. Sincerely promote your neighbors advantages (Romans 12:10, Philippians 2:3). Seek the good of your neighbors (1 Corinthians 13:4-7). Have humble opinion of yourself and respect others, including their gifts from God. Perform such duties in love, cheerfully and with compassion in their misfortune. Trust God over your strength, others favor, and fortunes. Accept the lot God provided, even when catastropheslike pandemic, war, fire, and faminehappen to you. Contemplate the mercy and love of God. Always bless God and trust Him (Psalm 79:13). Have a calm, contented, and grateful mind because we are assured that whatever happens to us is ordered by the Lord and is most conducive to our salvation (Psalm 131:1-2). God is the ruler and arbiter of fortune. A summary of a sermon by John Calvin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVqSv3oTSkw",

    "How to Deal with Depression": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller If we are depressed and cannot feel Gods presence, even when we dont think we have done anything wrong, what should we do? Lets learn from Psalms 42 and 43. The author was very depressed. He felt God had forgotten him (v42:9). He didnt think he had sinned, but he had lost his relationship with God and he was experiencing spiritual darkness. What could have caused it? First, he had lost his community. Previously, he was with a joyful, religious crowd, but now he was isolated in the mountains (v42:4,6). It is easier to feel depressed if we dont have others support. Second, bad things were happening to him, leading people to ask him all day long where his God was (v42:3). Gradually, he also asked God the same question (v42:9). Third, he had lost his appetite (with tears as his food) and lost his sleep (crying all night) (v42:3). Such setback, failure, and physical weakness, with no support, particularly when he didnt know the cause, could have led to his depression. How did the author get back up again? Though the author felt down and out, he didnt stop praying. Instead, he desperately searched for God, pouring himself out to Him (v42:1, 4). He also reminded himself to consider the love of God in his life (v42:6, 8). Furthermore, he kept preaching to himself. Three times he questioned himself why he was so miserable. Three times, he told himself to put his hope in God (implying not in worldly things). And three times he said he would praise God, his Savior (v42:5, 11; 43:5, 3:3). If we are depressed for a long period, we should take care of our health and find support from others. But it is much more important to keep praying to God, remembering His love as shown by Christ suffering for us. Also, we should keep asking ourselves why we are sad and remind ourselves to put our hope in God, praising Him as our Savior.

    "Are You Putting GOD in a Box?": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller We tend to have our own idea of what God should do. This is the perfect time for you to show your power, God. Why dont you stop the injustice? If God does not meet our expectations, we feel disappointed. It turns out Gods top prophet, Elijah, had a similar experience in 1 Kings 19:1-18. Ahab, Israels king, had made Baal to be Israels god. Elijah, before the Israelites, challenged the 450 Baal prophets. Through a spectacular miracle, he got all of them killed. The over-confident Elijah ran to Jezreel, the capital of Israel, perhaps expecting Ahab and the Israelites to repent and return to God. Instead, Ahabs wife threatened to kill him within a day. Elijah ran for his life. He even let his servant go, implying quitting his ministry (v3). Totally demoralized, he asked God to let him die (v4). How did God treat Elijahs depression? Twice, an angel touched him, fed him, and let him sleep (v5, 7). Strengthened by the food, Elijah travelled for 40 days to Horeb (or Mount Sinai), where Moses had been given the ten commandments. God asked him what he was doing there (v9). Elijah responded that he was the only one zealous for Him, basically asking, Whats wrong with you, God? Why didnt you show your power and do what I think you should? (v10). Elijah assumed God would do certain things in Israel. When God didnt follow through, Elijah became overly pessimistic: I am the only one left (v10). Elijah tried to put God in his box, and when God was not there, Elijah grew cynical and depressed. As described above, God treated Elijah with comfort, sustenance, sleep, and time. He also just allowed Elijah to talk without condemning him. Then God responded. First, God showed a glimpse of His strength through powerful wind tearing mountains apart, earthquake, and fire. Then God gently talked to Elijah, telling Elijah His plan. God counseled and healed Elijah with gentle words. Gods ways are beyond us. Dont try to put God in our box. Instead, have faith in the almighty and brilliant God, and listen to His words. God will do the right thing at the right time. Summarized from a Tim Keller sermon: https://gospelinlife.com/downloads/the-still-small-voice-8969/",

    "How to Get Out of Spiritual Darkness": {
        "content": "Adapted from a Tim Keller Sermon Sometimes it feels as if God has disappeared from our lives. We can become desperate and depressed, confused as to what we may have done wrong. We may be more equipped to charge forward and attack problems than to maintain our faith in setbacks and sickness, particularly when we dont know why. In those moments, what should we do? The author of Psalms 42 and 43 was experiencing spiritual darkness. He searched desperately for God, like a parched deer. Note that he didnt express any guilt, implying he didnt think he had sinned. Spiritual dryness and disappointment are inevitable, but long periods can derail our faith. What might be the cause? The author was enduring a difficult time, such that his enemies were taunting him about where his God was. Distraught, he found himself asking God the same question (Psalm 42:3,9). He might have lost his support group. Previously, the author was in the house of God with a large, festive crowd, but now he might be isolated in the mountains. We need a community. We need to be actively involved in and supported by others (Psalm 42:4,6). He might have been physically deprived. Crying all night with tears as food, he wasnt sleeping and eating right. Physical weakness and fatigue can lead to depression (Psalm 42:3). What did the author do? He kept praying, pouring out his soul and dryness to God. He remembered the love of God, the God of his life (Psalm 42:4, 6, 8). He preached to himself and put his hope in God. Three times he questioned his soul, Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Then three times he responded, Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God. (Psalms 42:5,11; 43:5). We must learn to tell ourselves to shut up and preach Gods grace to ourselves: ask if youve forgotten what God have done for you; if youve forgotten His love, that He demonstrated in sending His beloved Son to die for you. Anchor in God and praise Him. To conclude, to get through spiritual darkness, we must: earnestly pray to God, remember His love, find a support group, mind our health, preach to ourselves, and trust and praise God.

    "Our Hope Shapes Us": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller Our hope for the future can greatly influence our choices today. For example, our feeling towards a very boring or strenuous job changes if the job could bring us a lot of money. Similarly, if we believe death will end everything and leave us to rot like dinosaurs, then the distinction of right/wrong, kindness/cruelty, and good/bad holds much less significance. Does life really have meaning? Is life sacred? Or are we any different from trees? What we hope for shapes our life and attitude. The biblical meaning for hope is different from our daily usage. I hope he will succeed doesnt mean he will succeed, but in the Bible, hope implies certainty in the outcome (Hebrews 11:1). Lets learn about the Bibles hope from Ephesians 1:11-14,18. Christians rest their hope in Christ (v12). God showed His love for us in giving His only Son to suffer and die for us. On earth, Christ was rejected by all. On the cross, He was rejected even by the Father. At that point, Christ had no hope and no Father so we could have both. Before Christ, we were nobody, with no future and no God (Ephesians 2:12). Through Christs death and resurrection, we become Gods children and possession (v14, 1 Peter 2:10). Because of Christ, we have a glorious inheritance, guaranteed by the Holy Spirit in us (v14, 18). When we receive our inheritance, all of creation will be redeemed from decay and death (Romans 8:21-24). All creation is longing for that day. When it comes, even trees will sing for joy (Psalms 96:12). But in the meantime, life on Earth is difficult. Christ lived a perfect life, yet He was tortured and crucified. He told us that if people hated Him, people would hate His followers also. But no matter what happens, ultimately everything will turn out for His glory and our good. This hope sustains and strengthens us. As Gods cherished children and possession, be alert and sober, and set your hope on our wonderful future in Christ (1 Peter 1:13).

    "Living Hope Eclipses Suffering and Pain": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller Victor Frankl, a Jew, survived through multiple Nazi concentration camps. His book, Mans Search for Meaning, describes the experiences of many who suffered. According to him, some turned brutal and cruel. Suppressing their pain and hardening their hearts, they became indifferent to suffering. Some who were dumped by their spouses became bitter and cynical, trivializing or demonizing the opposite sex. Some gave up all hope, shriveled up, and died. Some held on, hoping someday they might get back what they had lost (e.g. health, family, fortune, and achievements). But after liberation from the camps, with their hope not realized, they became depressed, disillusioned, and even suicidal. They tied their hope to transient objects; when they couldnt get them, they didnt want to live anymore. Surprisingly, according to Victor, some didnt turn brutal and cruel. They had a hope that suffering couldnt destroy. The differences in their hope determined their life trajectory. Concentration camps condense life into a very short time. To avoid ruination, we need a living hope. Christ suffered immensely. In great sorrow, He even sweated blood at Gethsemane. Through His suffering and resurrection, Christ took our condemnation so that we could be reconciled with God forever (2 Corinthians 5:21). For the joy set before Him, He ran the race (Hebrew 12:2). Seeing what His suffering has accomplishedour salvationChrist is satisfied. We are the source of Christs living hope (Isaiah 53:11). What is our living hope? Lets learn from 1 Peter 1:3-9. Through Christs suffering and resurrection, we can be reconciled to God (v9), and we receive what Christ deserves (2 Corinthians 5:21). One day, there will be no more death, mourning, crying, and pain (Revelation 21:4). Our faith may even result in praise, glory, and honor from God (v7). This is our living hope. It is independent of our circumstances. It is not based on our power, our health, or others approval. It is imperishable, safe, and secure in heaven (v3-4). With this living hope, we dont need to suppress our current grief. Instead, grief and joy can co-exist. In verse 6, both are in the present tense! Current grief can even drive us closer to God. Thus, we could live joyfully even in suffering and pain. Summarized from a Tim Kellers sermon: https://gospelinlife.com/downloads/born-into-hope-5219/",

    "In Tragedy, Grief with Hope": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller Tragedy is inevitable. Lets learn from the Lazarus story (John 11:1-53). Lord, the one you love is sick, Martha and Mary, Lazarus sisters, told Christ, but still He waited for two days before going over (v6). When He arrived, Lazarus was already dead for days, and they questioned Christ for not coming sooner. To Marys question, Christ wept. He knew He would raise Lazarus from the dead (v4), yet He cried (v35). Christ weeps with those who weep because He feels our pain. To Marthas same question, Christ didnt console, but told her, I am the resurrection and the life (v25). He taught her the truth: He is the life, and He would make everything new, with no more death. Christ was also deeply moved with indignation (v33, 38). The original Greek word means filled with rage and anger. Christ wasnt angry at others, such as the Samaritans or Muslims, or at Himself. He wasnt angry at Lazarus. When Job was suffering, Jobs friends accused him of sinning, leading to Gods punishment. Dont make assumptions about Gods intention based on your immediate circumstances. A smooth life could be a result of God giving us over to our bad desires. If we stay proud and stupid, we will perish (Romans 1:24-32). Christ warned that victims of a political massacre or a falling tower werent worse people than others (Luke 13:1-5). Remember that Christ lived perfectly but suffered terribly. We shouldnt assume that our immediate circumstances are a direct reflection on Gods approval or disapproval of us. In Lazarus story, Christs anger might be for death at the tomb (v38). Then, He brought Lazarus back to life. Christs action led to the Pharisees plotting to kill Him (v53). Christ fixed their problem, yet He soon would be facing a much bigger one. In our life, there will be tragedy. When tragedy strikes, grieve, but grieve with hope (1 Thessalonians 4:13). Express your anger against the tragedy. Lay your pain and suffering before Christ. Our God will weep with us and teach us the truth. He is the resurrection and the life. Because of His blessings, He will make everything new and right again.

    "New Hope That Gives Us New Life": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller Christ told Nicodemus to be born again (John 3). Was this just a fancy marketing term to intrigue Nicodemus? Nicodemus was a Pharisee on the Jewish ruling council, suggesting he was a fervent, successful, and highly honored follower of Jewish law. Yet, Jesus told him to be born again. Starting all over again is not just a call for the wicked or the weak to improve, but even the most respected. Lets learn what born again means from 1 Peter 1:3-13, 23. Born again gives us a living hope (v3). What we expect of the future directly shapes how we live today. Without a vibrant hope for something much bigger than ourselves, many of us live for nothing but selfish desire, which inevitably leads to a meaningless life that amounts to just fidgeting aimlessly while waiting for death. Christ on the cross has given us a living hope of a wonderful salvation, with non-perishable inheritances in heaven (v3-5). With this hope, our joy and sadness are not dictated by our environment. This hope shifts us away from depending on our power, wealth, and other earthly things to rescue us (Psalm 33:17). With this hope, we can rest in Christ and His salvation. On Earth, pain and suffering are common, but suffering should drive us deeper into the living hope, which can give us joy even in the midst of great pain (v6-7). We cannot have this new hope or get this new birth through our effort. To be born again is to be brought on by Christ (v23). We should trust in Christ to bring us a new beginning and give us a new hope. We will see the world through the lens of the Gospel, shifting our focus from worldly things to Christ. Then gradually, we will change and grow. Summarized from a Tim Keller sermon: https://gospelinlife.com/downloads/hope-for-your-life-6024/",

    "We Need Someone to Hold Us Accountable": {
        "content": "A Lesson from John Ortberg We are accountable for the lives we lead and the choices we make. But were quick to make excuses for our mistakes. This started since Adam and Eve, with Adam blaming Eve and Eve blaming the serpent. This tendency to shift blame still haunts us today. On judgment day, we are accountable to God. We must give an account of ourselves to Him, including everything we have done and every empty word we have spoken. (Romans 14:12, Matthew 12:36). Our account to God also includes sins of omissionthat is, the things we should have done and did not. God holds us accountable for what He has given us (Matthew 25:19, 29). Nothing is hidden from Him, with all our secrets judged (Hebrews 4:13, Romans 2:16). Let us start today to be honest, take responsibility of our mistakes, accept our faults, and stand up again. With Gods offer of forgiveness and grace, we can have a fresh start. One secret to successful physical training is to have partners holding us accountable. They can encourage each other and keep each other focused on their goals. Similarly, we should have an accountability partner to help train our character and train us to be godly (1 Timothy 4:7-9). A successful accountability relationship is difficult. It requires honesty and takes courage. We can make our commitment with our partners to follow Christ. Confess sins to each other. Be honest and open. This will help us heal (James 5:16). Ask our partner to remind us of our commitment, and the good thing we should be doing. This can help us do what we cannot by ourselves. Accountability can be a key factor in our progress towards godliness. It can push us toward love and good deeds (Hebrews 10:24). Such an accountability partner is Gods gift for us, and since we will be accountable to God, let us start with our accountability partners today.

    "DISCIPLINE Your Children": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller How to raise children? Lets learn from Ephesians 6:4: Do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. This includes discipline or setting up firm rules, and also includes counseling, listening, and reasoning. Teach them who God is to you. Share your testimony and point them to the Lord. Pray with them and for them. As parents, we need to live lives consistent to our beliefs and strive to strike a balance between truth and love. If we have too much discipline, we forget that they are not robots. If we focus too much on loving and nurturing, we forget that they are not adults; sometimes they must obey without fully understanding. They need to be independent, and so we must learn to let go. Trust them and let them fail but do it progressively. Give them the support they need, and do not push them to be independent too quickly. The above is difficult to do without the guidance of God and the Gospel. For example, we may under-discipline, perhaps because we want their approval or are too eager for their love. But the Gospel frees us from such needs. Our approval is from God, and God loves us. We may over-discipline, perhaps because we base our identity in them or consider them a reflection of ourselves, and so we fear their failure. Again, the Gospel frees us from such need. Our identity is in God. Some of us may not want our children to be independent, perhaps because we want to be needed. We try to get from them what should be from God. Or some of us may push our children to be independent too quickly. This could be because we are selfish and only think of ourselves. We forget they are blessings from God. To conclude, we should raise our children through God and the Gospel. We must balance truth and love, dependence and independence, and point them to the Lord.

    "Friendship": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller Friends are important. But sometimes our busy culture forces us to prioritize other things, such as family and job. Yet real friendship is crucial and picking friends randomly will ruin us (Proverbs 18:24). What are attributes of real friends? A real friend cares in good times and bad (Proverbs 17:17). Many want to be our friends if we are useful to them, but a real friend sticks by us even in adversity. A real friend gives us earnest advice, bringing joy to our heart (Proverbs 27:9). Real friends sharpen each other (Proverbs 27:17). A real friend does not flatter and is candor (Proverbs 27:5-6). Open rebuke is better than secret love (Proverbs 27:5). Though he tells us as it is, he also feels our pain. A real friend should be able to feel our sorrow and joy. A real friend always lets us in and never lets us down. Thats why a real friend is better than a sibling (Proverbs 17:17, 18:24). Because friendship takes time and effort, its unwise to try having too many friends. Thats fine because particularly in todays world, a real friend is scarce anyway. So how do we find real friendship? First, we should focus on something else. Real friendship is built on a common foundation and interests. A person has no fellow travelers if he does not go anywhere. Second, we should be a real friend ourselves. This requires us to have the capacity to give. Christ exemplifies real, perfect friendship. He lets us in, by revealing Himself to us (John 14-17, 15:15). Also, irrespective of what we do, He cares for us to the point of sacrificing Himself for us. He does not let us down. With Christ as our real friend, we have no fear of being let down by others. This gives us the capacity to give. A real friend probably has to be discovered. Once we find a real friend, we have to strengthen it, as our highly mobile society is quick to move people apart. In conclusion, we must let Christ be the friend our hearts desire, and in turn we will build real friendship with others. When we focus on following Christ, we can be real friends, and that is how we will have real friends. Adapted from a Tim Keller sermon. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Tc4VIQrXdE",

        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller Today, we look into our relationships with our parents and our children. The Ten Commandments teach us to honor our parentsnot love, not trust, not admire, not enjoy, and not obey, but honor them. Some parents are obnoxious and make it difficult to love or enjoy them. Some parents are not trustworthy. Some parents are not admirable. Some parents are not safe to obey. Also, one day, a child should leave the parents authority and be united with his or her spouse (Genesis 2:24). But we are still called to honor our parents, no matter how flawed they are. This is a choice and is not sentimental. We are commanded to treat our parents with dignity, courtesy, and respect. We should try to follow the custom because what is considered respectful differs by culture. To honor them, sometimes we need to forgive them, particularly when they are really bad or manipulative. To honor is different than seeking their approval. Many yearn for their parents approval, but we must remember that our parents cant be our God. We mustnt let our need to please them dominate us, lest their approval become an idol. Remember that we have Gods unconditional acceptance. We dont have to prove that we are good. That knowledge can empower us to freely honor our parents. As to our children, Ephesians 6:4 teaches us to bring them up in the training and instruction of Godagain not love, trust, admire, enjoy, or obey. Training involves discipline, and instruction involves teaching and counseling. In traditional families, fathers have absolute authority. After the industrial revolution, many parents now leave home to earn a living, and they delegate others to bring up their children. But parents should not have absolute authority and should not delegate. Parents need to bring their children up. This is a kind of servant leadership. The bringing up is in the discipline and teaching of God. To conclude, we dont need to get our approval or acceptance from our parents or our children. Our approval and acceptance are from God. This will free us to honor our parents and to bring up our children in Gods training and instruction.

    "Sex and LGBTQ+": {
        "content": "Summaries of Lessons by N T Wright and Tim Keller Christians should try to understand major issues regarding sex and LGBTQ+. Understanding helps us live peacefully with those we disagree with (Romans 12:18). Regarding sex, our culture worships sexual love, believing that sexual urges should never be resisted, as they make life worth living. Such a culture totally discounts the fulfilling and joyful life of, and wisdom in, monastic lifestyles. Having said that, we know that sex is powerful. Chemicals released in sex bind people together. For those in a cohabiting relationship, breaking up can be as traumatic as divorce, like tearing apart the flesh that has become one. Some transgenders define their gender by looking inside their hearts to find their identity. Such reflections can be problematic because our hearts can deceive us (Jeremiah 17:9, Mark 7:20-23). Some supporters of this approach to define gender claim that ones physical is irrelevant relative to spiritual. However, the Bible is keen on the corporeal also. Homosexuals share very different traits, but numerous Christians just focus on prohibition (Leviticus 18:22, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10). In ancient Rome, homosexuality included not only pedophilic relationships between powerful men and boy slaves, but also gay couples in long-term loving and faithful partnerships, with many willingly choosing the submissive role. In Gods original design for sexuality, God considered good in the creation of male and female (Genesis 1:27-31). But homosexuality or heterosexuality, by themselves, dont get us to heaven or hell. Christ talked about greed 10 times more than adultery, considering greed as a terrible sin. But greed, by itself, also doesnt send us to hell either. Christ teaches the importance of loving our neighbor. Our neighbors include people of different races, sexual orientations, and religions. Spending all our time and money for ourselves is sinful and deviates from our original design, but by themselves, such self-centered behaviors also dont send us to hell. What sends us to hell is self-righteousness and believing that we are our own savior or lord. What sends us to heaven is realizing we are sinners, and we need Christ to intervene. The key is to rely on Christ, not on ourselves or our actions.

        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller Today, dating typically starts with outer attributes. Is that person pleasant looking, sexually attractive, doing well, or well-connected? If yes, the next steps are dating, and then caressing and sex. If that works out fine, then both parties might consider commitment. But sex is a powerful force. It can muddle up our thinking. Relationships should start from friendship to see if both sides can understand, accept, appreciate, and work with each other, preferably towards common goals. Then they move on to deeper friendship, romance, and commitment, before going to sex. Fulfillment in sex comes from deep physical intimacy and full commitment from both sides. So, sex and marriage should be tied. Masturbation focuses on just giving ourselves satisfaction. After reaching climax, one can feel emptier and lonelier. Also, masturbation depends on fantasy and is addictive. Dont let it control you. Dont try to know everything about the other person before committing. We are imperfect. Your relationship with your spouse depends on God, and your intent to honor Him and to honor your commitment. Also, God continues to work on us. So, dont be too cautious. After we have spent some time with a person and we really like that person, we should trust God and commit. What if we are constantly being rejected in dating? Try to identify the reasons. Ask your close friends for suggestions. Then move on and seek out other opportunities. Some want to remain single. That can be a good choice. Paul recommended being single (1 Corinthians 7:1-7), and Christ was single on earth. Though God said it was good for Adam to have Eve (Genesis 2), happy marriage is difficult to have because we are imperfect. A spouse can reprogram your self-image, which could inflict damage on you. So, dont be fixated on getting married or being single. Some idolize being single because they value independence. Others treat being single as a plague. Avoid both. For some, being single comes easily. That is a gift. But for most, it is better to be married. Ask God for guidance, and thank God for the outcome, whether you are single or married.

    "The Married, the Single, and Sex": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller Traditional culture discourages being single, but we are imperfect. How can imperfect couples live happily ever after? Couples need to give up their independence and work together to resolve many conflicts. 1 Corinthians 7:3-4 even describes sex as being controlled by ones spouse. So, it is understandable that many are cynical towards marriage and glorify independence. But remember that God did not just create Adam. God created Adam and Eve to be together. Having said that, for Christians, it is also fine to be single. Paul even suggested not looking for a wife in 1 Corinthians 7:27-28. In other words, dont be too eager to get married. A few other issues. Our culture puts too much emphasis on sexual immorality. 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 describe a list of bad characters. They include the sexually immoral, thieves, drunkards, slanderers, and swindlers. Both greed and sexual immorality are on the list. If we define greed as an intense selfish desire for wealth, power or food, then both greed and sexual immorality focus on selfish needs. But our culture treats the sexually immoral much worse than the greedy. How do we control our appetites? Learn from those who diet. They bear hunger for something desirable, such as health. Similarly, we should abstain from frivolous sex for something desirable, such as more fulfilling sex, a happier spouse, or a better relationship with God. For those who could not forgive themselves for their past sexual mistakes, remember that we are imperfect. We constantly love something else more than God, committing adultery against Him. But the blood of Christ has cleansed us. Christ has forgiven us, like He had forgiven the adulterer in John 8:8-11. So, forgive our past mistakes and leave our former life of sin. Focus on God. Only God can truly satisfy us. Summarized from a Tim Kellers sermon: http://www.gospelinlife.com/free-sermon-resource",

    "Sexuality and Christian Hope": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller The hope of Christians reshapes their view on sex. Some consider sex as an appetite, like their urge for food (1 Corinthians 6:13). Some consider sex as something dirty that should be avoided (1 Corinthians 7:1). For Christians, God created sex and considered it as good. Via sex, two become one flesh, united not just physically, but emotionally, mentally, and spiritually, fully committed and giving totally to each other (1 Corinthians 6:16-18). So Christians should flee from sexual immorality and sex outside marriage, and instead give up their independence for intimacy with their spouse, just as God voluntarily sacrificed His independence and became a vulnerable human to have intimacy with us. However, being single without romance and sex is fine too (1 Corinthians 7:27-31). Traditional culture emphasizes family. In the olden days, women were nobody if they were single. Nowadays, many believe life on earth is everything, so finding sex, romance and ones true love are paramount. Christians hold different views. Whether married or single, Christians shouldnt be too eager to change their status (1 Corinthians 7:27-31). Christians views on sex, singleness, and marriage are based on their hope in the ultimate family, journey, and love. Christians anchor their hope on the ultimate family of God, not on their spouses or children. The world in the present form is passing away; dont be too attached to it (1 Corinthians 7:29-31, Mark 10:29-20). Marriages among imperfect couples are a long and hard journey (1 Corinthians 7:28). Even if youve married the perfect person, they will change. A Christians hope isnt confined by the worldly journey, but instead rests on the ultimate journey of helping their spouse to become holy and blameless (Ephesian 5:25-27). Christians also hope for the ultimate love, to be united with God (1 Corinthians 6:17). When the Samaritan woman asked Christ for living water, Christ talked about her sex life (John 4:15-18). No man could satisfy her. Only Christ could. Christ is the ultimate lover we need. Whether we are single or married, our hope should be in God. For those looking for a spouse, find one with the same focus. For the happily married, dont make the other side your idol. For the unhappily married, put your hope in God.

    "Love, Lust and Liberation": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller Lust is powerful and addictive. Look at the huge pornography industry. But Christ said, I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart (Matthew 5:28). Yet, the Bible rejoices in sex and sexual desire. Genesis 1 depicts God creating sex through male and female. He called His creations very good. In Genesis 2:23, before God, naked Adam characterized naked Eve as bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. The Song of Solomon celebrates sexual love, for example with one admiring the others body when the other was going in for sex (Song of Solomon 5, 7). Sex should unify two persons, not just physically, but emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. But sex without marriage means the parties only want to be united physically, with each holding onto their own life. They are splitting their bodies from their souls. Sex should be an integrated act. It should re-confirm each party belonging completely and exclusively to the other. Thus, sex should be limited to marriage. Lust is different from sexual desire. When a man lusts for a woman, he wants her body only, but not any other parts of her. He has dehumanized her. Lust is also an excessive desire. One can be totally driven by lust, making it the center of ones life. It is like an idol. After getting the others body, one still feels empty. There is no deep fulfillment in lust. The passage on lust (Matthew 5:27-30) also points to eyes and hands. Eyes refer to what one perceives, and hands refer to actions. Have the right perception. Know that physical attraction is good but is just skin deep and cant be meaningful. Also take the right action. Run away from lustful environments. Sex in marriage is wonderful, but it cannot replace God as the center of our life. Christ constantly refers Himself as the bridegroom, who accepts and loves us, His bride. Through faith, we become absolutely beautiful in Christs eyes. Christ becomes the center of our life. Only He could give meaning to our life, with deep fulfillment.

    "Charity and Its Fruits": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Jonathan Edwards The Fruits of Love The spirit of love is a humble spirit that (1 Corinthians 13:4-5): Sees Gods infinite power, holiness, and loveliness (Psalm 113:6; Isaiah 6:5, 57:15; Job 42:5-6; Psalm 51:17; Matthew 5:3; Job 4:18-19, 15:15-16; Genesis 32:10; 2 Samuel 7:18). Sees our natural meanness and filth, and how unworthy and distrustful we are (Romans 12:3). Gives all glory to God and willingly accepts His command and sovereignty (Psalm 115:1). Is content with our status no matter how desperate, without envying those better off, without greed for honor, and without pursuing selfish ambition (1 Corinthians 13:4-5, Jeremiah 45:5, Romans 12:16). Accepts that society has levels and is willingly to give those above us what they deserve (Romans 14:7, Titus 3:1). Confesses faults and appreciates reproval from those who have love or are good (James 5:16; and Psalm 141:5). Doesnt show off or puff up to those below us and doesnt assume others will respect us (1 Corinthians 13:4-5, Matthew 23:5, Philippians 2:3, Ephesians 3:8). Doesnt look down on others (Romans 12:16). Isnt stubborn regarding our private interest, but willing to yield (2 Peter 2:10, 1 Corinthians 4:7, Matthew 5:40-41). Such humble love will lead us to love others, giving them the honor and respect they deserve, and hate our sin. Though Gods attributes dont include humbleness, Christ on earth demonstrated humble love. He became human (the worm of the dust), lived humbly as a servant, and remained obedient unto death on the cross. His behavior should kindle our love for Him, lead us to follow His example, and make us despise all earthly glory (Philippians 2:6-8; Matthew 10:24-25, 20:25-28; John 13:13-16). We should carefully examine ourselves. Our original natural is arrogant, which God detests and punishes (Habakkuk 2:4; James 4:6; 1 Timothy 3:6; Proverbs 16:5, 6:16, 29:23; 2 Samuel 22:28; Isaiah 23:9). Earnestly strive to have a humble, gentle, and loving spirit. This is the spirit of Christ on earth. Such a spirit of love will lead to receiving His rich promises and, ultimately, the crown of glory in heaven (1 Peter 3:4).

    "Re-imagine Law for Lawyers": {
        "content": "Adapted from a Tim Keller Sermon, Titled \"Re-imagine Law\" God instructed Adam to work and take care of the Garden of Eden. Similarly today, farmers cultivate natural resources to produce food; musicians re-arrange notes to produce music that nourishes the soul; and investment bankers organize labor, talent, and financial capital to meet human needs (Genesis 2:15). So, what about lawyers? Whats the function of the law? God proclaimed, I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt. Then God gave the Ten Commandments. The use of the possessive in the phrase your God conveys intimacy, implying relationship. Just as seeking to please others enhances relationships, God expected the Israelites to follow His laws (Exodus 20:1-17). Psalm 81:10 echoes this: I am the Lord your God, who brought you up out of Egypt. But what follows is Open wide your mouth and I will fill it. Theres a connection among obeying Gods laws, fostering our relationship with God, and God filling our needs to help us flourish. Because we are fallen, human-made laws are more coercive (negative) to preserve order and prevent chaos. Yet, like salt preventing decay and enhancing flavor, lawyers should apply the law to prevent society from deteriorating and bring out the best in people (all made in Gods image). In other words, the laws true purpose is to promote relationships and human flourishing. Sometimes litigation is necessary to uphold justice and deter wrongdoers but avoid it when possible because it consumes enormous resources. Lawyers must also examine their idols. Something legal and aligned with a clients wishes may be wrong. Lawyers should serve justice for the sake of human flourishing, not human-made laws nor a clients desires alone. Human-made laws depend on the principles theyre based. Our current laws are more secular than religious. They reflect prevailing beliefs regarding human nature and needs. A purely secular foundation is fragile. For example, marriage laws change when the intention shifts from creating stable communities for raising children to individual self-fulfillment. Or consider laws regarding human rights: They cannot rest on majority opinion, for they exist to protect the marginalized, nor can they be grounded in evolutionary logic, which favors the strong over the weak. For Christians, laws on human rights are based on the belief that all people are created in Gods image. Thus, lawyers should follow God to set and uphold laws that strengthen relationships and enable human flourishing.

    "Meeting God in the Desert of Our Soul": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Buddy Owens There can be three types of deserts or wilderness in our life: (a) The heat and pressure in our life have turned way up. (b) Our hearts have turned cold, with our passions gone. (c) We have given out so much that we feel empty with nothing left to give. Deserts may be a training ground. In the Bible, God met many significant figures in the wilderness, such as Moses. For example, in the desert, David earnestly sought God, and he learnt and grew. Psalm63:1. So, if we are in the wilderness, try not to get out in a hurry. Try to learn from the experience. Then, at least we can reduce the chance of getting there again. Let the valley of pain, suffering and darkness become our door of hope. Hosea2:15. Trust Him that at the right time, He will lead us out. When we are in the wilderness, keep doing what is right. Gal6:9. Also, consider doing the following: (a) Prepare to meet God there. Isaiah40:3-5. Stay alert, make ourselves available, and wait for Him expectantly. Psalm 5:3. (b) Plant seeds for spiritual growth. Listen to Gods word, retain it in a good and honest heart, and persevere to produce a crop. Luke8:11,15. (c) Eliminate unnecessary distractions. Prepare a straight, smooth road for GodRaising up valleys, lowering mountains, straightening out crooked paths, and leveling rough spots. Isaiah40:3-4. Focus on important things and say no to unimportant ones. Set our minds on things above, not on earthly things. Colossians3:2. (d) Search and remove idols from our hearts. They can be false things our culture worships that we sacrifice our life for. Do not imitate the culture around us but remove those idols from our life and from our lips. Hosea2:17. If we follow worthless idols, we will become worthless. 2Kings17:15. If we cling to worthless things, we will forfeit Gods love. Jonah2:8. Instead, we should replace passions for idols with passions for God. (e) Praise God. Sing to Him because singing helps focus our attention. Psalms63:5,7. Hosea2:15. We can worship God with our songs, so keep songs in our hearts. That can be where God is going to meet us. To conclude, if we are in the wilderness, learn from the experience. Wait for God, prepare for Him, and praise Him so His glory can be revealed for everyone to see. Isaiah40:3-5.

    "Pray Sincerely and Not Selfishly": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Zac Poonen Prayers can be powerful, particularly a righteous persons earnest prayer (James 5:16). Lets understand some attributes of prayers. Prayers are not for informing God what we or other people need. God knows what we need even before we ask (Matthew 6:8, 31-32). Prayers are not primarily for making requests. Parents do not like their children to talk to them only when they have needs. Prayers should not be artificial, and theyre not for impressing or influencing others (Matthew 6:5). Prayers are to God. Prayers should not be meaningless repetitions to fill time (Matthew 6:7). We should be conscious of what we say. Prayers can be long if we are alert and genuine. Typically, a long prayer starts with a burden. In prayers, we must communicate sincerely and open our hearts to Him. God wants to have fellowship with us and wants us to speak freely and intimately to Him, like children talking to their warm and loving father. Pray alone often. Christ often withdrew to the wilderness to pray alone, sometimes praying all night (Matthew 6:6; Luke 5:16, 6:12). Asking for things in our prayer is fine, particularly valuable things, such as the forgiveness of sins (Matthew 7:11, Luke 11:13, James 4:2). Though God knows what we need before we ask, God wants us to express our needs and experience the joy of Him filling it. In asking, we should be persistent. We can even ask with shameless audacity. (Luke 11:5-13, 18:1-8). We should learn from the Lords prayer. It is not self-centered. It uses the word our but not words like my, I, or me. The Lords prayer starts with Our Father in heaven. The Old Testament never addresses God as Father. We can because through Christs death and resurrection, we can be Gods children (Romans 8:16). Addressing Him as our Father implies that He loves us and wants to help and bless us (Romans 8:32). The term in heaven implies at least power, wisdom, and glory. After all, God is the Creator of heaven and earth. Know the significance of praying to our Heavenly Father. This is the foundation of our faith and the basis of our prayer.

    "Why Pray?": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Stanley Toussaint Christ tells us not to babble needlessly when we pray. Why? What is the function of prayer? Lets learn from the Lords Prayer on how to pray and why (Matthew 6:7, 9-14). The Lords Prayer starts with wishing that Gods name be honored (Matthew 6:9). This is important. For example, God brought the dispersed Israelites back into Israel to demonstrate the holiness of His great name (Ezekiel 36:16-25). Then the Prayer wishes that Gods kingdom come to earth; and that His will be done on earth as in heavenperfectly, immediately, and joyfully (Matthew 6:10). The following verses ask God for our daily needs, and that He forgive us as we forgive others. (Matthew 6:11-12). This forgiveness is not about salvation specifically, because Christ was talking to the disciples, but it implies that we shouldnt hold grudges if we want to walk with others. The final verse asks God not to lead us into temptation but deliver us from evil (Matthew 6:13). Although God doesnt tempt us to sin, this is a request that He guide us away from bad situations where we might stumble. All the above are requests for God for very specific things. Other prayers in the Bible include asking for rain (James 5:17-18), wisdom (James 1:5), sending workers to do Gods work (Matthew 9:37-38), removing some annoyance (Matthew 15:23), taking away certain pain, or fulfilling the needs of others (Hebrews 7:25). We thank (Philippians 4:6), adore, and praise God, but those arent prayers. Prayer is asking God for something specific, not out of selfishness, but so that God may be glorified (John 14:13). God is glorified by anything that reveals His nature. How God responds to our prayer shows His love, wisdom, and glory. Through our prayer, we know Him better and are led to worship Him (Jeremiah 9:24, Philippians 3:8). When God answered the prayer of Abrahams servant to bring a wife for Isaac, the servant bowed down and worshiped God (Genesis 24:26). So, pray earnestly and truthfully. Ask God for something specific, something that honors Him. Through this process, we will know Him better and worship Him, so that He may be glorified.

    "Prayers for Christians Who Are Suffering": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller Paul was fully aware of the pain and suffering early Christians were going through, such as being tortured, and losing their home, livelihood, and life. Some were eaten by lions in the Roman Coliseum, as entertainment for the Romans. Some were nailed to death on crosses. But Paul never asked God to alleviate their difficulties and sufferings. Lets observe how Paul prayed for them in Ephesians 1:15-23. In that passage, the people Paul prayed for had two attributes (Ephesians 1:15). First, their faith was in nothing but Christ. Second, they loved all Gods people, not just those similar to them or those they were attracted to. Though faith in Christ is primary, practice is necessary. If we never forgive others or if we keep cheating them, is our faith genuine? Faith in Christ should lead to a life that is more and more like Christ. Paul prayed that they would know three things (Ephesians 1:18-23). First was to know the hope coming from Christs calling to be the children of God. They were nobody when God called them (1 Corinthians 1:26-31). It was by pure grace that they could become Gods children, which should have given them immense hope. Second was to know the wonderful blessings God had promised themthe rich and glorious blessings they inherited as children of the Almighty God. Third was to know Gods great power for them. It was the power that raised Christ from the dead and put Him far above all things and above all authorities, at all times. Just imagine the magnitude of Gods power for His children! To gain such insights, Paul asked God to give them the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so they might know Him better (Ephesians 1:17). Meditate on these verses. To conclude, when we pray for suffering Christians, we should ask the Holy Spirit to enlighten them, to help them see the wonderful hope they have as Gods children, the immense blessings He promised to give to them, and His great power working for them.

    "Reject Christ, Grim Future": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Tim Keller If Christ is who He said He is, then He is the Son of God, our Creator, and the path to God. Could Christ be a myth? Proving anything absolutely is almost impossible. Practically any position we hold requires not just reason but also faith. The gospel was written soon after Christ and includes many eyewitness accounts. It takes more faith to assume Christ is a myth than otherwise. If the gospel is true, how can we explain the terrible things done in Christs name? The question should be whether those Christians really followed ChristHe died on the cross, prayed for His enemies, and stopped His followers from physically defending Him. Christianity is more effective when marginalized and loses effectiveness when in bed with power. Even Christ criticized the powerful religious leaders of His day. So why does God allow the strong to kill the weak? Feeling outraged by such behavior implies you believe in some objective standard of justice. Christians believe so too. But there are many aspects of God we simply wont understand. We are on a need-to-know basis. One thing we do know is that God is not indifferent, or He wouldnt have come to earth and suffered terribly. Having said that, Christians believe the long-term future of those who reject Christ is grim. Are such views too exclusionary? Some believe that all religions are equally good, like many blind men describing an elephant based on touching different parts of it. But such a hypothesis assumes that someone has seen the entire elephant or has the superior knowledge of the ultimate religion. This all-religions-are-equally-good view is equally exclusionary. Some believe that Christianity is socially constructed and only reflects those around them. Even so, one still needs to ask whether such beliefs are right or wrong. Christians belief rests on Gods grace, shown by the gospel, not based on living a good life or following the ten commandments. Many Christians faith is based on: Intellectual reasonableness; Personal resonance, including experiencing their weaknesses and the need for something much bigger than themselves to get them through life; and Social influence, including a desire to be a part of a Christian community they are attracted to. The Christian faith leads to God-centeredness that, in the long-term, brings a fulfilled life, while self-centeredness brings pain and suffering. Choose your path wisely and bear the consequences.

    "Is God Anti-Sex?": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Nicole Unice During the time of the New Testament, Corinth was a place of high culture and fast living. Whatever one did was no one elses business. This led to rampant and unfettered sexual immorality (1 Corinthians 6:12). To them, food was for the stomach and the stomach was for food. Both were temporary, similar to body and sex. Another idea was that body and spirit were separate and unaffected by each other. This led to some people only focusing on the mind, while others focused only on the body. Paul disagreed with such beliefs and behavior. He considered our spirit tightly integrated with our body, one significantly influencing the other (1 Corinthians 6:15-20). To him, the body was not meant for sexual immorality (1 Corinthians 6:13). Our current culture idolizes sex. In 2009, Atlantic reported that more than 90% of Billboard top 10 songs had messages on sex. Some people are even considered inferior if not actively involved in sex, with being celibate or single as boring, broken, and abnormal. But our culture also despises and stigmatizes sex. Some consider the media evil for promoting casual and consequence-free sex. Others blame pornography for causing distorted views on sex and leading to women being sexually assaulted. What should be our attitude towards sex? For Christians, the key is not sex. The key is our identity. We are valuable to God. God sacrificed Himself to wash away our iniquities and to make us holy. Such wonderful gifts were bought at a very high price (1 Corinthians 6:11, 19, 20; Philippians 1:6). Understanding our value is paramount. Sex should not be idolized or stigmatized. It is Gods design and therefore good. It is a gift for marriage. Having said that, being single is wonderful also (1 Corinthians 7). In the 1500 years after Christ, singles sat before the married in church gatherings, illustrating the importance of the singles. Both being married and staying single can be blessed. The key is our identity in Christ. Having been bought at a hefty price, we arent our own anymore. We should live a life to glorify God and honor Him with our bodies. Gods ways and designs far exceed ours. Follow Christ and we will flourish. Summarized from a sermon by Nicole Unice: https://menlo.church/series/thats-a-great-question#/modal/message/4946/mlo",

    "Why Does God Allow Suffering?": {
        "content": "A Lesson from John Ortberg Suffering is pervasive. As history progresses, we experience different forms of suffering. For example, in Medieval days, half of all children died before age 10. Now, with advances in technology, education, and lifestyle, our suffering is more often mental rather than physical. To illustrate, our anxiety towards suffering may have intensified. Sometimes, we bring suffering onto ourselves with careless decision-making, but often our suffering can seem senselessthe loss of a loved one, natural disasters. The 2004 tsunami, comparable to the power of 550M Hiroshima atomic bomb, killed nearly 250,000 people. Why do these things happen? If God is good and all-powerful, why doesnt He prevent them? The Bible is filled with writers protesting to God on sufferings, particularly what they considered the sufferings unjustified. Yet the Bible doesnt explain why there is suffering, other than the world is broken and cursed. How do we cope with it? First, know that our God understands suffering due to His personal experience. Christ went through the ultimate unjustified suffering: tortured, nailed on the cross, left totally alone, and even forsaken by His Father. The resurrected body still carried the scars of the nails, revealing a wounded God. Second, know that God suffers with us. Christ wept when His friends suffered (John 11:33-35). His love is always with us. Christians never suffer alone and are encouraged to seek comfort in friendship with one another. Third, know that there is hope. Christ shows the ultimate hope at His resurrection. One day, He will wipe all tears. Paul described his suffering on earth as light and momentary because eternal glory far outweighed his temporary pain (2 Corinthians 4:16-17). Finally, think beyond yourself. Help the least (Matthew 25:40-46) and suffer with those who suffer. Then we share Christs suffering and will share His glory (Romans 8:16-17). Though the Bible does not explain why there is suffering, we know our God understands suffering, and He suffers with us. One day, Christ will heal all wounds. We must learn to help others even in the midst of our own suffering. Summarized from a John Ortberg sermon: https://menlo.church/series/thats-a-great-question#/modal/message/4972/mlo",

    "Is Christianity Intolerant to Other Faith?": {
        "content": "A Lesson from John Ortberg Having passion for what is good can be a virtue. Some attribute the Christian zeal to always considering themselves being right, and even to the violent crusade. Is that true? Are zealous Christians intolerant of other faiths? Numbers 25 describes a period of time when many Israelites were unfaithful to their wives and slept with Canaanite women, leading them to idolatry and Israels eventual decay. To address Gods anger, Moses demanded death to the Israelites who were ardent followers of the Canaanite gods (Numbers 25:4-5). While Moses and the people were weeping, an Israelite took a Canaanite woman into his tent in full view of Moses. At once the priest Phinehas went in and speared them to death. God commended Phinehas twice for being zealous for His honor (Numbers 25:10-13). The word zealous took on a life of its own. Around 200BC, Maccabees defeated the Syrians, freeing the Israelites. Hanukkah commemorates this event, and Maccabees was praised for his zeal. As God reveals more of Himself to us, we advance in our understanding of Him. He reveals Himself to us through the life of Christ. When Christ was crucified, He didnt spear His persecutors. Instead, He took a spear from them. Christ shows that zeal for God leads to loving and suffering for our enemies even to the point of death, so as to help them. We should follow Christ. The term zealots was used to describe a group of Jews fighting the Romans. One of them was Saul (later known as Paul), who zealously persecuted the Christians (Galatians 1:13-14, Philippians 3:6). After his transformation by Christ, Paul realized he previously didnt know God (Acts 9:1-5). Paul described the danger of zeal without true knowledge (Romans 10:2). Such zeal could lead to severe cruelty in the name of God. Remember Christs most vivid condemnations were against the religious leaders at that time. We should ground our zeal on solid and true knowledge. Then our zeal will bless and not curse those who persecute us (Romans 12:11, 14). So, we should listen to, learn from, and share with those of a different faith. Dont just tolerate, but respect and honor them, so that Muslims, Buddhists, Jews, and Christians may come to know Christ.

    "Is Christianity Anti-Woman?": {
        "content": "A Lesson from John Ortberg Does Christianity favor man over woman? Does Christianity encourage husbands to rule over their wives? God, a spirit, transcends gender. He created male and female in His image, both getting the same blessing and calling to steward His creation (Genesis 1:27-28). After the fall, God proclaimed that the husband rule over his wife (Genesis 3:16). Like death, this is a curse. This is part of the suffering Christ came to save us from. If so, then how about: Man being made first? If order determines significance, then farm animals should be above humans. Eve as a helper suitable for Adam? (Genesis 2:18) The Bible also refers God as our helper (Psalms 33:20). Woman covering her head? (1 Corinthians 11:2-7) Paul might have suggested this as a way against sexual promiscuity when temple prostitutes in those days always exposed their heads. Also, didnt Jewish men wear prayer shawl over their heads when praying? Woman having long hair, while man short? (1 Corinthians 11:6, 14, 15) That was the culture. Didnt Samson also wear long hair as a sign of obeying God? The head of a woman being a man? (1 Corinthians 11:3) Such concepts reflected the social norm. Cultural changes take a long time. Learn from Christ. During those days, woman took care of things while man focused on learning. But Christ commended Mary for sitting at His feet learning instead of preparing the house for Him like Martha (Luke 10:38-42). In Christs time, a womans highest calling was childbirth and nursing. But Christ defined woman by the life she lived, by hearing and obeying Gods words, not by her husband or her child (Luke 11:27-28). Similarly, Paul commanded the husband to yield his body to his wife, as the wife yields her body to her husband (1 Corinthians 7:4). He endorsed women teaching or delivering messages to the congregation (1 Corinthians 11:5). Paul also taught both sexes to submit to each other (Ephesians 5:21). Therefore, husbands and wives should love, respect, encourage, challenge, serve, befriend, and cherish one another, regardless of gender.

    "Is Christianity Irrational?": {
        "content": "A Lesson from John Ortberg Christianity encourages learning. Christians founded 92% of the first 138 US colleges. Oxfords motto is The Lord is my light (Psalm 27:1). The verse You will know the truth and the truth will set you free (John 8:32) is probably on more US university walls than any other statement. Christianity encourages reasoning. Paul, a man of faith, reasoned, day after day, in Athens marketplace with the Epicurean (focused on what one could see) and Stoic (focused on reason/logic) (Acts 17:18). Our lifes foundation should pass through logic and reason. This will help us love God with our whole being, which includes our logical mind. Christians dont blindly follow authority. For nearly three centuries after Christ, Christianity grew under the hostile Roman Empire. Some believe there is no way to know the truth and treat morality as a matter of opinions, traditions, or preferences. On the contrary, God gives us enough to know Him and lead a godly life (Luke 1:4, 2 Peter 1:3, Romans 1:21). To gain knowledge, some totally depend on science. We rely on science and its method of measurable data to understand the natural world. But science cannot tell us why the universe came into being, the meaning of our existence, whether hope is more valid than despair, or whether people have equal worth. We need to have certain amount of knowledge and evidence of God in our personal experience. This will help us understand the visible and the invisible. Then follow what we have found, wherever it leads. Having said that, acknowledge we cant fully understand God (1 Corinthians 13:9, 12); and know that God will meet us in our doubts about Him. For example, Christ cured a child though his father asked Christ to help him overcome his unbelief (Mark 9:24). Christ told doubting Thomas to put his finger into His nail wounds, and his hand into His spear wound (John 20:24-29). Furthermore, beware that knowledge can make us arrogant (1 Corinthians 8:1-3). Sometimes, love can be more effective than winning arguments. If we have knowledge but not love, we are nothing (1 Corinthians 13:1-3). In conclusion, Christianity encourages reasoning, knowledge in science, and deepening our personal experience. But we should accept our intellectual limitations and know that without love, we are nothing.

    "Are Science and Faith That Incompatible?": {
        "content": "Having faith doesnt mean closing our eyes to facts. In fact, Christianity is also based on evidence, though some can defy our experiences and senses. When Christs disciples asked for proof, He told them He had been with them for so long, they should at least believe based on the evidence of His works (John 14:8-12). One piece of evidence for Christianity is the universe itself, which the Bible states is Gods creation. Evidence of such creation includes the Big Bang explosion, from a point of 1 billion degrees to the universes current temperature of 2.7 degrees. This supports the Bibles assertions that the universe had a beginning and wasnt created by anything within it (Romans 1:20, Psalm 19:1). Paul writes that Christ was seen by over five hundred people after his resurrection, with most of these witnesses still living during Pauls writing and many of them willingly dying in Christs name (1 Corinthians 15:6). First-century, non-biblical accounts from Josephus and Tacitus tell of Christs crucifixion and Christians refusal to worship the emperor. The Bibles historical validity is bolstered by thousands of the New Testaments manuscripts, ranging from 150 to 400AD, ensuring that the Old Testament was accurately copied. The two-thousand-year-old Dead-Sea scrolls represents 37 of the Old Testaments 39 books. Science also requires faith. Scientists have theorized about the Big Bang explosion, though no one has seen it. Scientists theorized about atoms for millennia before evidence of atoms was finally discovered last century via technology. Science has its limitations. According to science, matter and energy cant be created or destroyed. But according to the Big Bang Theory, they were created about 14 billion years ago. And its challenging for science to explain our sense of beauty and right and wrong. Finally, science rose from Christian societies and, to a certain extent, exists because of Christian faith. The scientific method was created by Christians who believed in two key principles: (a) the God-created universe has immutable order and rules; and (b) nature and matter are real, not an illusion, so we dont live to escape matter or transcend the corporeal. Also, Christianitys belief that humans are fallen creatures has led to the creation and practice of rigorous scientific investigations, and the creation of laws and government for checks and balances. Perhaps science and faith arent so incompatible after all. Summary of different sections in Parts 2 and 3, Does Science Point to God of the book Is Atheism Dead? by Eric Metaxas.",

    "Science Points Us to God": {
        "content": "Einstein predicted that the universe was expanding, which was later verified by Hubble. Then the Big Bang theory postulated that the universe was expanding from a specific point, which was once a billion degrees and is now 2.7 degrees Kelvin. This background temperature cinches the case that the universe had a beginningCalculated to be nearly 14 billion years ago. Such discoveries are evidence that the universe was created by an almighty Creator (Genesis 1:1). Consider life. The very possibility of life requires our universe to be extremely fine-tuned. Life on earth would be unsustainable if: The universes density changed by one part in 1015. The universes energy density was different by one part in 10120. The universes expansion rate one second after the Big Bang had been smaller by one part in 1017. The strong nuclear forces holding protons and neutrons together in every nucleus of every atom was 2% weaker or 0.3% stronger. The ratio between the strong nuclear force and electromagnetic force differed by one part in 1016. The ratio between the gravitational and electromagnetic force differed by one part in 1040. The value of the gravitational force was different by one part in 1034. Life itself is extremely complex. Consider a cell. In 1952, scientists artificially generated amino acids, the building blocks of life, by running current through a few elements. But the likelihood of producing even a simple protein of 150 amino acids by chance is one in 10164. Furthermore, the simplest living cell contains hundreds of specialized proteins, each of which perform different functions. Could the amino acids somehow join to form a cell? The process of generating an amino acid doesnt automatically repeat, and amino acids dont wait around for others to generate more complex structures; they decompose over time. Could life come from Darwinian evolution? One theory, based on natural selection, suggests that the more advantageous genes enable survival and are passed down. The problem with this theory is that it presupposes reproduction. Remember the amino acids. How can evolution take place before amino acids can reproduce? Therefore, the incredibly precise nature of the universe and the complexities of life on earth suggest an intentional and intelligent designer.

    "Sense of Right and Wrong - A Clue to the Universe's Meaning": {
        "content": "When we are wronged, we are quick to appeal to a common standard of behavior. We say things like, Howd you like it if anyone did the same to you; or Thats my seat, I was there first; or Come on, you promised. But for our own gain, we are quick to ignore this standard. In other words, we know whats right, and we dont care. This standard doesnt come from benefiting us, because doing whats right may be good for others or society, but detrimental to us. It isnt an instinct. Instincts can be incorrect, and the standard guides our instincts. It isnt a human convention because it transcends cultures. So, where does this standard come from? Our universe was either formed by chance or by a conscious and purposeful power. If this power exists, it couldnt show itself as something inside the universeno more than an architect of a house being a fireplace. One way for this power to show itself is by influencing us to behave in a certain way (moral law). We didnt create this moral law, and others cant see it by our behaviors because we follow it only sporadically. But it still exerts influence on us. This power is intensely interested in right conduct, like fair play, selflessness, courage, honesty, and truthfulness. In that sense we should agree with Christianity and some other religions that God is good. But this power isnt indulgent or soft, and doesnt seem to care how difficult or dangerous it can be to do right. If the universe isnt governed by a power of goodness, all our efforts to do good are hopeless in the long run. But if the universe is governed by the power of good, then we are making ourselves enemies to this power when we dont do what is right. If you agree that such a power of goodness exists, you should understand your desperate position and your need for Christianity. Christianity explains how God is the power behind the standard. Christianity tells us how we cant meet the standard, and how God became a man to provide a way for us to meet it and save us from Gods wrath. Christianity tells us to repent and promises us forgiveness if we do. Summary of Book One in Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis.",

    "What Good Is an Eye for an Eye?": {
        "content": "Lets learn from Matthew Chapter 5. The Ten Commandments provide a list of do and donts. But the Beatitudes focus on the person we should become to be blessed and prosperous (7-9). True blessing is not from wealth, power, or obeying the Law. True blessing is based on who we are, such as being meek, hungry for righteousness, merciful, pure in heart, and peacemaking. As we become blessed, Christ told us we will impact the lives of othersbringing out the good in others, preserving the good, and introducing light to those in darkness, so that others may see our good deeds and glorify our Father in heaven (Matthew 5:13-16). Then Christ emphasized He came to bring the Law to its fullness (17-20). The endgame is not obeying the Law, but to become like God. Christ explained with a few examples. He started with murder and adultery. Christ intensified the Law by considering having evil thoughts to be the same as committing the corresponding acts. The key is not just obeying externally but becoming like our heavenly Father (21-30). Another example is an eye for an eye. Previously, the law included appropriate compensation. If a Jew had ruined a carpenters eyes, he had to support his family because the carpenter could not earn a living anymore. But Christ told us to turn the other cheek if one cheek was hit and go two miles if demanded to go for one mile. We not only dont ask for compensation, but also give to our evil enemies more than they asked (38-42). The last example is to love our enemies (43-47). Perhaps nothing better demonstrates Christs character than this. He healed the wound of the soldier who came to arrest Him. On the cross suffering beyond comprehension, He forgave those who caused His intense pain. As we sin, He keeps forgiving, embracing, and helping us on our path of discipleship. Such perfection is impossible without our Saviors grace. It is a journey to gradually become like our heavenly Father (48). Matthew 5 gives us a glimpse into eternity. As of now, we must keep trying to be a light to those around us; serve, lift them up, and love them. Through Christs perfection, we become complete.

    "Who Are the Blessed? Who Are Living the Dream Life?": {
        "content": "Many listening to Christs Sermon on the Mount had dire physical and mental needs. Surprisingly, Christ told them they could be blessed (Matthew 4:23-5:10). Typically, those considered to be blessed are the talented, rich, powerful, healthy, beautiful, well-built, or crafty. Advertisements constantly depict the weak, poor, old, sad, awkward, fat, bald, or ugly as the unfortunate. However, according to Christ, those with desperate spiritual needs, those who consider themselves insignificant, are blessed. The humble, the gentle, and those who grieve are blessed (Matthew 5:3-5). Typically, we do not consider such people to be living the dream life. According to Christ, the determining factors of a blessed life are not based on what one owns, how one looks, where one lives, or how much one knows. There is no need to be the slave of the worlds demand. Because of Christ, we can be blessed. By depending on the grace of God, even the worst of us can be secure in the kingdom of God. The deplorable and the misfits, all can be blessed if they are in Gods kingdom. Not only did Christ see people differently, He was a friend of sinners (Matthew 11:19). He took them in as who they were. Alcoholics Anonymous success is at least because everyone there fully embraces each other as addicts. There is no pretending. Do not pretend there is no sin, assuming everyone is perfect and happy. Instead, accept everyone to be sinners, to be inadequate (1 John 1:8-10). Though we are a train wreck, God still accepts us as His children through Christ. This is the context of the Sermon on the Mount. May we see others differently than the world (2 Corinthians 5:16). May we see others as God sees us. May we accept others because God has accepted us.

    "Why Should We Care About Our Environment?": {
        "content": "A Lesson from John Ortberg Christ taught us the two biggest commandments are to love God and our neighbors. (Matthew 22:36-40). If so, why should we care about our environment or animals? One reason is because God loves them. After God had created the universe, He considered the creation very good (Genesis 1:31). Moreover, He loved them. In the famous verse, John 3:16, For God so loved the world, the word world in the original Hebrew means the cosmos, which include our world, our environment. If our boss loves something and considers it very good, shouldnt we care for it also? Another reason we should care for our environment is because that was the original job God assigned humans to do. When God created man in His image, God commanded him to rule over the creatures (Genesis 1:26). The word rule in the original Hebrew means being a viceroy, or a person representing the king when the king is away. So, on behalf of God, humans should take care of the creatures on earth, which God also had expressed His concern for (Jonah 4:11). Furthermore, Gods creation is full of wonders. There are numerous passages in the Bible admiring them. One example is the six verses in Psalms19, where David was in awe of Gods physical creation, including the heavens, the skies, and the sun. If we truly marvel our environment as the incredible work of the Creator, naturally we will take care of it. In conclusion, we live in a world created and cherished by God, who has entrusted it to humans. Learn to meditate on, cherish, and take care of the environment.

    "Christ's Generosity vs. Our Culture's": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Nicole Unice All four gospels teach us if we focus on ourselves, we will lose everything. But if we forget ourselves for Christ, we will have a real life (Luke 9:24-25). Our culture encourages generosity up to a certain point. Because of the scarcity mindset, we are inclined to keep things primarily for ourselves. But Christ teaches us not to hoard for ourselves treasures on earthincluding our time, ability, and wealthfor we will certainly lose them all one day (Matthew 6:19-21). As Gods children and as citizens of heaven, we should set our hearts and keep our focus on things above, with our feet down on earth (Colossians 3:1-3). Be generous with our things on earth to the needy. Be generous cheerfully. It is the antidote of anxiety. A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed. Sow generously and we will reap generously (2 Corinthians 9:6-7, Proverbs 11:25). Our generosity includes spreading our faith, a natural outflow from a grateful heart for what God has given us freely. As ambassadors of Christ on earth, we are His witnesses. Though we naturally evangelize what we love, we should prepare to give the reason for our hope in a gentle and respectful manner (1 Peter 3:15). Dont focus on outcomes. We dont know if God will give us the outcome we want, and our joy shouldnt depend on outcomes anyway. It is the path we walk, the journey we travel, that counts. God is rich in mercy and abundant in grace. He accepts and reassures us. He gives us a new citizenship and a new way to live. We give back because He will keep providing for us. Ask God to help you maintain a healthy regard for your earthly treasuresnot just blessings for yourself, but a means to serve others.

    "A Faith that Handles Wealth Wisely": {
        "content": "A Lesson from Rick Warren God is not opposed to wealth. Abraham, Job, Joseph, David, Solomon, Barnabas, and Joseph of Arimathea were all rich. But be careful with it. The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil (1 Timothy 6:10). Christians do not put our hope on wealth, but in God and in our relationship with Him (Proverbs 11:4, 7). We should never confuse our value with our wealth (Proverbs 13:7), but rather be content with what we have (Hebrews 13:5). If God blesses us with wealth, we should not feel guilty, shameful, or regretful (Proverbs 10:22), but know that these riches are on loan to us. Everything belongs to God; He could take it away anytime. We are called to be good stewards. Wealth can be a useful tool. Learn how to accumulate, acquire, and allocate it. In accumulating wealth, learn to save. Spend less than what you make (Proverbs 21:20), then invest. We should make money work for us, even when we sleep, instead of us working for money (Ecclesiastes 11:1, Matthew 25:14-23). But we are not called to hoard selfishly, for God is opposed to greed. We hoard out of insecurity and pride of our status. Also, whatever we accumulate, deteriorate, such as food, clothes, and precious metal (James 5:1-3, Luke 12:15-21). When acquiring wealth, forget get-rich-quick schemes (Proverbs 13:11). Make money honestly. Ill-gotten gains take away our lives; its better to keep our soul than be wealthy (Proverbs 1:19. Matthew 16:26). Treat others fairly (James 5:4, Proverbs 10:2, Proverbs 16:11). In business, multiple parties (customers, owners, workers, and society) need to benefit. In allocating wealth, give to God at least 10 percent first. He will provide (Proverbs 3:9-10, Malachi 3:8-12). Use money to make things flourish. Use money to love people. If we have a lot and do not share with those in need, we have sinned (James 5-6). Be generous, particularly with those in need (Ephesians 4:28). In turn, their plenty will supply what we need (2 Corinthians 8:14). Whoever refreshes others will be refreshed and will prosper and truly live (Proverbs 11:24-25, 1 Timothy 6:18-19).

    "Choose Your Work Carefully": {
        "content": "Our Heavenly Father invites us to work. Why? He could do everything without us, yet He chooses to involve us. Perhaps He wants the work to give us dignity, responsibility, or a sense of significance as we strive to make a little difference, however little, on earth. Weve seen people do good work throughout history. Examples include the disciples forming the first century church; the founding fathers of democracy in the eighteenth century; the generation who fought Nazi-led genocide; the civil rights leaders who fought racism; parents in every generation building up stable families; and creators of technologies that liberated many. According to some studies, we still have more than 40 million people held illegally in slavery. Kids are forced to roll cigarettes fourteen hours a day, and kids younger than ten are sold to pedophiles. We need people to raise their voices to identify the culprits. We need people to stand up, using law enforcement and survivor services, to stop such practices. If Christians do good work, the work will serve as light to the world, shining before others, who may see these good deeds and glorify our Father in heaven (Matthew 5:14-16). Having said that, we must be careful to recognize the right types of work. For example, during the twelfth Century, fighting in the Crusades probably was considered the work God wanted the people during that time to do. In the story about Martha and Mary, Martha thought she did a lot of work for Christ. But Christ reminded her it was more important to quietly listen to Him (Luke 10:38-42). Having a good relationship with God and developing ones character take precedence over work, as they both inform our decision on what work we should do. By doing such work, we are following God. This gives us a glimpse of His Kingdom on earth. May our work be good deeds, shining before others, so they may glorify our Heavenly Father.
